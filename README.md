# etch-a-sketch

In this project we have to make a grid of a size chosen by user 
so to do it firstly i made a function createGrid which manipulates the dom and alter some css properties
then i made the grid by using css property grid

After that i made a removeGrid function which works whenever "CLEAR BUTTON " is pressed it just empty the node.

After that i made a setGridSize function which validates the size provided by user.

and in the end i added an EventListener with clear button which calls the above function in order to work properly.
